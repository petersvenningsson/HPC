## Implementation plan

- **Planning phase**: Discuss and plan the assignment. How will we divide the work load? What are the major challanges for this problem?

- **Define the program layout and interfaces**: We will have a number of different modules in this program. How will they communicate with each other?

- **Mathematical survey of the problem**: Evaluate all roots for the task-specific polynomials as well as the derrivatives.

- **Implement the sub modubles**:

- **Benchmarking**:
